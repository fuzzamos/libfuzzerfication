<Title>
NIST conformance test suite for XMLSchema Part 2: Datatypes.

<Summary>
This is a conformance test suite for XML Schema built-in simple datatypes,
as defined in W3C Recommendation "XML Schema, Part 2: Datatypes" of
May 02, 2001 (see http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/).

</Summary>

<Description>
<Objectives>
<P>
The objective of this test suite is to provide a collection
of conformance tests for the built-in simple datatypes defined
in the W3C Recommendation for XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes (see
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/). All the built-in
primitive datatypes are represented, as are all the built-in derived
datatypes whose derivation is by restriction and which may appear alone in
an instance document with no internal or external references to entities
other than a defining schema document and the XML Schema namespace for
instances (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance).
</P>
</Objectives>

<Scope>
<P>
The scope of this test suite covers all built-in primitive datatypes,
as well as all built-in derived datatypes which satisfy the following
conditions:

</P>
<P>

1. Derivation is by restriction, and 

</P>
<P>

2. A value of the datatype may appear alone in an instance document
with no internal or external references to entities other than a
defining schema document and the XML Schema namespace for instances
(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance).

</P>

<P>
All constraining facets defined in the Recommendation are tested against
the types to which they apply.
</P>
</Scope>

<Form>

<P>
The form of the tests is as follows: for each built-in datatype, for each
applicable constraining facet, a number of schemas are provided. Each
schema defines a new type by restricting the built-in type by some value
of the facet. For each of these schemas, a number of instance documents
are provided. Each instance contains a single value from within the
value space defined by its defining schema.
</P>
<P>

In general, five schemas are provided for each valid type/facet
combination.  When it is not possible to derive five distinct restriction
values for a particular type/facet combination (e.g. byte/totalDigits,
where only three distinct values for totalDigits are permissible) the
number of schemas will be fewer.
</P>
<P>

Five instances are provided for each schema except in those circumstances
where the value space of the restricted type contains fewer than five
distinct values (e.g. a type derived from byte with the facet maxExclusive
== -127 has only one value in its value space).
</P>
<P>

For those facets which are scalar in nature, such as length, maxExclusive,
totalDigits, etc., the upper and lower bounds on the value space as
defined in the Recommendation are always tested in the provided schemas,
and the upper and lower bounds on the restricted value space as defined
in the provided schemas are always tested in the provided instances.
</P>
<P>

The tests in this collection contain only legal values of the lexical
representations of datatypes, as defined in the Recommendation. For
schema-conformant parsers, no errors should be expected  in the processing
of the provided tests.
</P>

</Form>

<Omissions>
<P>
No tests are provided for the following built-in types, for reasons
outlined above: IDREF; ENTITY; NOTATION; IDREFS; ENTITIES; NMTOKENS.

</P>
<P>
For built-in types double and float, the special values NaN, INF, -INF,
-0 and 0 are not tested.

</P>
</Omissions>

Technology, an agency of the United States government, and as such is
not subject to copyright within the United States of America.
