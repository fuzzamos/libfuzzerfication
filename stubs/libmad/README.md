# Note!

* libmad is not currently under active development but still widely in use.
* libmad: Invalid memory read in mad_bit_skip, attekett tried to find active developer, but all contact channels seem inactive.

Website at http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/ has contact info for licensing and couple of links to mailing-lists that haven't been used in ages(for anything else than spam).

MAD also has a SourceForge project at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mad/. Last update 2013 and last release update 2004. All 40 bugs reported to SourceForge are with status "open" and no activity from developer side.

I decided to report this issue to Ubuntu Launchpad. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libmad/+bug/1494164 (restricted view)

2016-07-07 - Got reply that no one is "actively" looking at the issue. Also got recommendation to contact oss-security mailing-list, if someone over there would be interested.
