Example of fuzz test running.

# Why?

* We wanted to do some fuzz testing for popular libraries.
* Purpose was to create a social startup. We wanted to increase awareness about situation.
* Purpose was that people could easily run libfuzzer on their own computer or cloud

---

# When?

* I was working as a summer trainee for 3 month in ouspg
* Compulsory training that is part of my studies
---

# Who?

* I was responsible for the project but had a lot of help from others. Atte Kettunen worked as specialist and participated mostly at the early summer.
* Also other people contributed.

# About libfuzzer
* LibFuzzer is open-source library (part of LLVM)
* It is similiar to AFL (American Fuzzy LOP)
* Works inside process (function) -> faster
* libFuzzer itself is compiled without any specific flags
* Target is compiled with fresh clang using MSan, ASan or USan

---

# Stubs

We have following stubs:
* ImageMagick
* haskell-x509
* libmad
* libxml2
* libxslt
* lua
* mysamplelib
* zlib
* rust [WIP]

---

# How?

* We used docker to automate the deployment of applications inside software containers.
* We have dockerfile for every fuzzer
* Image can be built from dockerfile
* Container can be run from image

# Findings

* We fuzzed ImageMagick and found use after free
* libxml and others were also fuzzed but nothing special was found (these are already heavily fuzzed)
* Purpose is to fuzz rust also
