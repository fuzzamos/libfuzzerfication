# Getting started

##
See the [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B46AMry7lHs&feature=youtu.be) about stub writing.

## Requirements

Before getting started you need the following requirements:
* [Docker version 1.11.2](https://www.docker.com/)
* [docker-compose version 1.8.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)

## Clone repository

First thing you need to do is to clone git repository.

```console
git clone https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication.git
```

## Get the libfuzzer-base image

```console
cd libfuzzerfication
```

Then you have to get the libfuzzer-base docker image.

```console
docker pull ouspg/libfuzzer-base
```

**Alternatively** you can build libfuzzer-base yourself if you want but it takes longer time.

```console
docker-compose build libfuzzer-base
```

## Build the stub image (ImageMagick in this example)

In this example we are going to build ImageMagick image

```console
docker-compose build ImageMagick
```

## Running fuzzer

Run the container

```console
docker-compose run ImageMagick
```

Fuzzer should produce output like this:

```

```

The NEW line appears when libFuzzer finds new interesting input.

The pulse line shows current status and appears periodically

## Samples

There is usually no point running fuzzers without samples. Currently samples are mounted from ~/samples/libfuzzer-target (ImageMagic example: ~/samples/libfuzzer-imagemagick) to /srv/fuzzer in container. Results are mounted from ~/results to /srv/fuzzer/results in container. Some sample files are provided in repository but larger sample sets should be used with fuzzers.

## Writing your own stubs

### General

1. Build libFuzzer itself without any compiler options (included in libfuzzer-base)
2. Build target with fresh clang using:

* one of the sanitizers (asan, msan, ubsan)
* fsanitize-coverage=edge[,8bit-counters,trace-cmp,indirect-calls]
* Usually -O1 or -O2 for speed
* But -O0 may be better for fuzzing


You can start writing your own stubs in the top of the libfuzzer-base image. See [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B46AMry7lHs&feature=youtu.be) example of writing stub for libxml2.
You can read about libFuzzer and find some examples from here: http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html.

If you want to write your own stub but don't know what you want to fuzz see our [target tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oj0L44gKTn3wlrJk6b554b9o8H0r1bVfb6LJrw62BEE/pubhtml)
