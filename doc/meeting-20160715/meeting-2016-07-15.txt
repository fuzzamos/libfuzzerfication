Meeting 15.7.2016

Discussion about MVP

libfuzzer-base documentation is tells howto run in native
we dont support how to use libfuzzer natively -> use libfuzzer-base
quality of libfuzzer-base is important!
use ubuntu in base image, no need to change

run:
-docker (we document libfuzzer only in docker, not in native)
--own engine
--cloud engine

Corpus pool:
-no feedback

results:
- log file
- documentation how to get results from log files

-corpus:
-we are going to use bundled corpus

scale:
-1 instance : 1 target

-stubs:
-libav is broken
-policies, packaging documentation, build documentation, run documentation
-stubs can also be used by other fuzzers
-main product are stubs
-Important: how to build and run a stub! prio high
-no need to change directory structure or file locations

cloud
-For scaling
- documentation!

docker-compose:
-rss_limit_mb=4096' not needed in docker-compose?
-default values for fuzz.sh that can be overrided

docker base image:
RUN chmod +x /src/scripts/fuzz.sh not needed,
chmod a+x fuzz.sh

corpus, samples in documentation when to use which

mikko creates initial corpus, small, use lfs

corpus cloud project gets started

mikko takes care of bundled corpus

split project between corpus and libfuzzer
