LibFuzzerfication is a project thats purpose is to do fuzz-testing for applications and libraries.

Example of lua fuzz test running.

# Motivation
There have been lots of vulnerabilities in popular libraries that should have been (theoretically) easy to test. We want to offer easy way to fuzz-test these libraries and increase awareness about the situation. We also want this to be available to everyone.

---

# About libfuzzer
* LibFuzzer is open-source library (part of LLVM)
* Relies on compiler instrumentation to get coverage feedback
* It is linked with the library under test
* Works fully in process -> Fast!

---

# What we have done this far?

* We have currently following stubs in repository:
- haskell-x509
- ImageMagick
- libav
- libxml2
- libxslt
- lua (newest)

#Documentation

Documentation has beed improved. You can find improved documentation from github:

https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication

---

#Under development
- libflac stub is currently under development
- Pauli (@WhiteEyeDoll) is currently working to get fuzzing running in Google cloud

#Feel free to contribute
* Everyone can contribute

# How does this project work?
* You pull container from Dockerhub
* Start Writing your own libfuzzer stub
* Share dockerfile with other users
* Use libFuzzer to collect corpus so that other people can continue where you left off

You can start writing stubs without docker.

Visit #ouspg @ IRCnet if you're interested!
