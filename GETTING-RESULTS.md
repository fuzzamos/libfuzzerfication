# Getting results

* On every kind of failure libFuzzer prints a stack trace. It dumps reproducer file to disk and then exits the process. In libFuzzerfication fuzz.sh script takes care that fuzzer is started again and is running all the time.

* Every stub's container saves repro file on host machine's $HOME/results directory. Also log including stack trace and other information is saved to results directory.

* You can try to reproduce errors by starting a new container and mounting a repro file in it. After that you can run fuzzer stub with that repro.
