<para>This document summarizes requirements and use cases for possible enhancements
to XInclude.</para>
</abstract>

<legalnotice role="status">

<para>Implementation experience has led users of XInclude to suggest a
number of enhancements. These enhancements would allow XInclude to support
the needs of richer applications by providing mechanisms to address
uniqueness constraints, to communicate with processes that occur after
XInclude, and to take advantage of the fragment identifier scheme
for <code>text/plain</code> documents.
This document attempts to enumerate these enhancements.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>It has been several years since the XInclude Recommendation
was published. This document outlines the requirements and use cases for
to changes to XInclude: support for
<biblioref linkend="rfc-5147"/>
and improved communication between the pre- and post-inclusion Infosets.</para>
</section>

<section xml:id="rfc5147">
<title>Support for RFC 5147</title>

<para>XInclude offers facilities for both XML inclusion and plain text
inclusion. In its current design, the use of fragment identifiers (in
the <tag class="attribute">xpointer</tag> attribute) is forbidden when
performing plain text inclusion.</para>

<para>The publication of RFC 5147 introduces a fragment identifier
syntax for text/plain content. It would be very useful to be able to extract
portions of a text document with RFC 5147 fragment identifiers just as it is
useful to be able to extract portions of an XML document with XPointer.</para>

<para>XInclude should be extended to support RFC 5147 fragment identifiers
when <code>parse="text"</code> is specified.</para>

<section xml:id="text-pointer-design">
<title>Text pointer design</title>

<para>It's worth considering, briefly, the possible design choices that
could be made in adding support for RFC 5147. Three seem apparent:</para>
