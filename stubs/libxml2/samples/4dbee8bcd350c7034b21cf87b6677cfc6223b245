<title>Optical Collisions Pump - Probe ( - Detection) Scheme</title>
<desc>
<h:div xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<h:p>
A LiNe potential system is used to illustrate the principle of an optical
collision with a pump-probe scheme. Given are the ground state X 
corresponding to Li(2s), the first excited states A and B corresponding to 
Li(2p), the C state corresponding to Li(3s) and some more potential
curves corresponding to Li(3p) and Li(3d). The last states are not 
excited in the principle demonstrated here and play therefore no
important role because they are well separated from the other
stated contributing to the optical collision. 
</h:p>

<h:p>
The collisons happens at thermal energies, in the used experiment
with crossed atomic beams in a vacuum chamber.
This means, the collision itself is shorter than a picosecond
with a well defined collision geometry and selected collision
energies.
</h:p>

<h:p>
With a first laser an electromagnetic field (light in the red range) is 
provided to have an excitation from X to A or B at a well defined 
atomic distance, because the laser is detuning vom the 2s -&gt; 2p 
resoncance. 
</h:p>

<h:p>
For a positive detuning the B state can be excited, for a negative
the A state. This happens either at the incoming or the outgoing
of the collision. In this demonstration an excitiation in the 
B state is assumed.
</h:p>

<h:p>
This first excitation is the so called pump process. It prepares
the collisional molecular system in exactly one electronic state. 
A second laser in the infrared range is provided for a further
excitation in another excited state within the collision, 
here from B to C in the outgoing channel of the collision.
This is called the probe process, with different detunings
and polarisations of the second laser the collisional system
can sbe analysed.
</h:p>

<h:p>
After the analysis and after the collision the still excited
Li(3s) is detected using a third laser to transfer it into a
Rydberg state, Li(25p) for example. This state lives long 
enough to survive the travel to a rotatable detector using 
field ionisation to detect each single atom finally.
