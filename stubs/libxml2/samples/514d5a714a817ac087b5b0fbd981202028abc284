<hs>Simplified diagram of an optical collision</hs>
<p>
An optical collision of the collision pair Na+Ne in the center of mass system is
provided in an animation.<br />
The classical model with trajectories (path, cyan) for the distance vector between the
two atoms is used.
</p>
<p>
The collision is described in such a way, that the neon atom (green) is fixed in one point
and the sodium atom is comming in in the ground state (blue) from the left.
With one laser directed perpendicular to the canvas is light provided, which  is not
resonant to the isolated sodium or neon, but near to the transition from the ground 
state of the sodium to the excited state.
</p>
<p>
At smaller distances of the sodium to the neon the interaction of the atoms between
each other change the resonance energy of the collision pair. At a specific atomic distance
the resonance condition is fulfilled. This distance is called Codon radius. Distances with
the Condon radius are represented with a yellow circle.
</p>
<p>
The intersection of the trajectory and the circle with the Condon radius is the position
of a possible excitation. Therefore they can be excited within the collision.<br />
In contrast to the ground state with spherical symmetry the excited state has another
shape, which is aligned. Alignment and shape can be directly measured (measuring points,
black Stars; polarisation dependency of the transition dipole moment).<br />
In the presented example the excited state is aligned in the direction of the internuclear
axis - alignment and internuclear axis of the moment of excitation can be directly 
extracted from the measurements.
</p>
<p>
After the excitation the sodium atom moves out to the right (red to magenta).
The alignment of the excited state continues to rotate at small distances with the
direction of the internuclear axis, but stops to rotate then.<br />
The timing of the state after the excitation leads to a change of the shape.
</p>
<p>
The presented rectangle has a length of the edge of 20 Bohr's radii or slightly
more that a nanometer. The relative velocity of the two atoms is about 1200 m/s.
The area is therefore crossed in about a picosecond.
</p>
<help>
Activation or clicking the logo below shows the moment of excitation for
about 20s as a still image.
