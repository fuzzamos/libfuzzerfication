<p>This draft specification is a work in progress representing the current
consensus of the W3C XML Working Group. 
This is a W3C Working Draft for review by W3C members and other interested
parties. 
Publication as a working draft does not imply endorsement by the W3C
membership. 
While we do not anticipate substantial changes, we still caution that further
changes are possible and therefore we recommend that only 
experimental software or software that can be easily field-upgraded be
implemented to this specification at this time. 
The XML Working Group will not allow early implementation to constrain their
ability to make changes to this specification 
prior to final release. 
This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other
documents at any time. 
It is inappropriate to cite W3C Working Drafts as other than "work in
progress".</p>
<p>It is the intent of the XML Working Group that this namespace facility
should become an integral part of some future version of the 
XML specification.</p>

<p>This document describes a simple method for qualifying certain
names used in Extensible Markup Language documents by associating them

<head>Motivation and Summary</head>

<p>We envision applications of Extensible Markup Language
<bibref ref='XML'/> where a document 
contains markup defined in multiple schemas,
which may have been authored independently.
One
motivation for this is that writing good schemas is hard, so it
is beneficial to re-use parts from existing, well-designed schemas.
Another is the advantage of allowing search engines or other
tools to operate over a range of documents that vary in many
respects but use common names for common element types. </p>

<p>These considerations require that document
constructs
should have universal names, 
whose scope extends beyond their
containing document. 
This specification describes a mechanism,
<emph>XML namespaces</emph>, which accomplishes this.</p>

<p>XML namespaces are based on the use of
<termref def='dt-qname'>qualified names</termref>, 
<!-- fluff
similar to those long used in programming languages.
Qualified names-->
which contain a single colon, separating the name into a
<termref def='dt-prefix'>namespace prefix</termref> and the 
<termref def='dt-localna
