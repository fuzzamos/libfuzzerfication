			<p>This document outlines use cases, requirements and
            design choices for XML Security 2.0, specifically
            Canonical XML 2.0 and XML Signature 2.0. It includes a proposed simplification of the XML
      Signature Transform mechanism, intended to enhance security,
      performance, streamability and to ease adoption.</p>

This is requirements and design 
options for XML Security 2.0, including Canonical XML 2.0 and XML
Signature 2.0.
            </p>
<p>
The Reference processing model and associated transforms currently defined
by XML Signature <bibref ref="ref-xmldsig2nd"/> are very general and open-ended, which
complicates implementation and allows for misuse, leading to performance and
security difficulties. Support for arbitrary canonicalization algorithms,
and the complexity of the existing algorithms in order to meet various
generic requirements is also a source of problems.
</p>
<p>
Current experience with the use of XML Signature suggests that a simplified
reference, transform, and canonicalization processing model would address
the most common use cases while improving performance and reducing
com
